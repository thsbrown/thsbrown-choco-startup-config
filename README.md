# After Reformat Chocolatey Config
This is my config file for the amazing [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) package manager! It's used primarily after a factory reset of windows. 

## Quick Start
To install all files in the config file simply pass it to choco install as an argument (additional info [here](https://chocolatey.org/docs/commands-install#packagesconfig)).

`choco install packages.config --yes`

We include the `--yes` flag above to allow Chocolatey to skip all the "Are you sure you want to install?" prompts when installing our packages.
