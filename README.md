# After Reformat Chocolatey Config
This is my config file for the amazing [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) package manager! It's used primarily after a factory reset of windows. 

To install all files in the config file simply pass it to choco install as an argument (additional info [here](https://chocolatey.org/docs/commands-install#packagesconfig)). See example below

`choco install packages.config`
